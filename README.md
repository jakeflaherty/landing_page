# landing_page
Use html &amp; css to create a landing page from scratch.
This project will require calling upon everything learned so far, and touching on a few areas that have yet to be explored. Googling when stuck is highly encouraged; get used to searching for solutions when things aren't working the way you expect them to. Upon completion, you should have created a generic landing page that could be used for a number of different situations.
